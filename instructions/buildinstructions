Attached should be what I was planning for the pin connections to the
pipistrelo (though I wouldn't necessarily bet on the number of blank
rows between the two sides being right - a fence post error would be
really easy and I can't check since you have the board ATM). 

For each of the VGA connectors we want:
Pin  Signal
1---R
2---G
3---B
4---NC
5---GND
6---GND
7---GND
8---GND
9---NC
10--GND
11--NC
12--NC
13--HSYNC
14--VSYNC
15--NC

The wide end is the top row with pins 1-5, then 6-10 in the next row
down and 11-15 in the bottom (narrow) row. For female connectors looking
at the solder buckets in each row you count up from left to right (I
think - I'm pretty sure that's right if the middle row is offset to the
left rather than the right of the other two). 

I will make you an image for the FPGA that will output a pattern with
the screen split into quarters and one each of red, green, blue and
white, then you can test connections with a monitor: if it doesn't give
anything then it's probably HSYNC, VSYNC or GND and if any of the
colours are wrong then there's something iffy with that colour (might be
the signal line or it's matching ground; pins 6, 7 and 8 are the colour
grounds). 

Have you got a windows or linux machine handy to flash the board? It's
probably possible from other operating systems but I've never tried it
and there isn't a handy prebuilt app to do it.
